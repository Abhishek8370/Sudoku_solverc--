# Sudoku_solverc--
This code is an implementation of a Sudoku solver using backtracking. It solves a given Sudoku puzzle by recursively trying different numbers in empty spaces and backtracking when an incorrect number is inserted. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code includes necessary header files (`<iostream>`, `<algorithm>`, `<vector>`) and defines constants `N` and `n`.
2. The `printBoard` function is used to print the Sudoku board.
3. The `checkRow`, `checkCol`, and `checkBox` functions are used to check if the numbers in rows, columns, and boxes (subgrids) of the board are valid, respectively.
4. The `checkBoard` function checks if the entire Sudoku board is valid by calling the three above functions.
5. The `findNextSpace` function finds the next available empty space in the board (denoted by the number 0).
6. The `insertBoard` function inserts a number into a specified index on the board.
7. The `canInsertBoard` function checks if a number can be inserted into a specific index by temporarily inserting it and checking if the resulting board is still valid.
8. The `solveBoard` function solves the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. It finds the next empty space, tries numbers from 1 to N (inclusive), and recursively solves the remaining puzzle. If a solution is not possible, it backtracks by undoing the previous insert.
9. The `main` function initializes the Sudoku board, takes input from the user, and attempts to solve the board using the `solveBoard` function. The result is then printed.

To use this code, you can compile and run it on a C++ compiler, and enter the Sudoku puzzle as input. The program will output the solved puzzle or indicate if it is impossible to solve.
